👋 Hi, I'm Raghava Thyagaraj

🎓 Master’s student in Computer Science at Pace University, NYC

🌏 Born in South India, now building my future with data & code in the Big Apple 🗽

💼 Aspiring Data Engineer : 
      I don’t just work with data—I engineer trust, structure, and speed into it.
      My passion lies in transforming raw, chaotic data into clean pipelines that businesses can rely on. 
      Whether it's batch processing, streaming, or automating ETL, I love every step of it.
      
🧰 Tech Toolbox:
PySpark · SQL · Azure · Databricks · Kafka · Airflow · Pandas · Git

🌱 Currently Deep-Diving Into:
dbt (for modern data transformations)
DataOps (CI/CD for data pipelines)
Real-time streaming with Kafka & Spark
Cost-efficient design in cloud data architectures

⚡ Fun Facts About Me:
I believe a good data pipeline should be like a subway train: fast, reliable, and on schedule 🛤️
I enjoy visualizing data insights as much as creating them.
I’m a night owl coder 🌙 who thinks best with a coffee in hand ☕
Side passion: teaching tech to beginners & simplifying complex topics 🧠
